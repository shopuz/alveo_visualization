<p>
Alveo Visualization is an attempt to provide a basis for the endless possibilities with the datasets and API provided by the Alveo Project. These visualizations not only provide a beautiful way of looking into the data but also help in understanding and analysing the dataset.
</p>

<p>
The visualizations rely on the API key provided in the configuration file.
Make sure you have the configuration file (alveo.config) at your home directory. If you have not downloaded your configuration file yet, please log in to <a href="hcsvlab.org.au"> Alveo </a> and download it from there.

<p class="alert alert-warning">
Note that the examples here are not very optimized for a large dataset and do not aim to be a standard way of approaching the visualization.
